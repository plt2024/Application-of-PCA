Objectives of the Exercise:

Project 2D data onto principal axes to better understand its structure.
Reduce feature space dimensionality while preserving essential information.
Analyze explained variance to determine feature importance and noise reduction.

Expected Results:

PCA will transform the dataset into a new coordinate system where the principal components capture the most variance.
The explained variance ratio will indicate how much information is retained in each principal component.
The dataset will be visualized in a lower-dimensional space, making patterns and relationships clearer.
